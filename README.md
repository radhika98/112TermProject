# 112 Term Project
This is a game I created for my Fundamentals in Programming class (15-112). 
Holiday Fighter is a fun, interactive game (based off of Google’s Halloween game: https://www.google.com/doodles/halloween-2016), where the “center guy” (so either Santa, cupid, bunny or ghost) needs to get rid of the monster before the monsters eats the main guy. Each Monster has a letter above its head, and the user needs to draw that same letter in the top left box in order to eliminate the monster before the monster touches the main guy. The game also includes different levels, and lives will be lost if the monster touches the main guy. The installation for this game is very simple..all it uses is Tkinter!! So all you need to run this program is Tkinter and the images that come with game and the helper file which allows the game to have buttons. As long as everything is in the same directory, and Python 3 and Tkinter are installed, the game can run on any device. However, you might have to redirect the path to which the pictures are. The path needs to match the path in the code or else the images won’t appear.
